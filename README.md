# Nosh
First project for coding bootcamp

Live site can be accessed here: https://adomoshe.github.io/project1/

Nosh is a recipe searching app that filters by dish or by ingredients. First step: choose what you want to cook. Nosh will then show you the nearest place you can buy the ingredients you need.

# Issues

Nobody's perfect, and nobody builds an ambitious project expecting nothing to go wrong.

It took a long time to figure out how the chosen APIs of the project would work together. We tried using Flickr to grab media and display it next to the search results of each dish.

Sometimes the websites used for API data did not load well enough to display its contents we grabbed in the iframes we used. Our iframes were therefore blocked as a result of server quality that's out of our control.

Bootstrap elements messed with our fonts and positioning if we werenâ€™t careful about scope.

Debugging was a learning process that required more precise communication than any other task. Some Issues that broke the code were fixed faster with the attention of the whole team. It never hurt to ask for help!

# Contributors:

We are a team of 5 developers from a code bootcamp cohort in Berkeley, CA just starting our sixth week in the program! Our backgrounds range from recruitment, martial arts, and even agriculture. We were tasked with creating a responsively designed, dynamic application with multi-API support.
